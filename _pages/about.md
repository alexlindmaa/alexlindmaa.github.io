I am a researcher working in the field of condensed matter physics. I rely on a variety of theoretical and computational metohds such as functional theories, machine learning, and statistical physics. Condensed matter physics involves the study of large numbers of electrons and nuclei that interact with each other according to a fixed set of rules known as quantum mechanics. Starting from these rules, I develop and implement methods that can used to simulate the behaviour particular condensed matter systems, with emphasis on realistic materials.
