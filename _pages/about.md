I am a condensed matter physicist. In my research I rely on a variety of theoretical and computational tools such as variational approaches, machine learning, and statistical theory. Condensed matter physics involves the study of large numbers of electrons and nuclei that interact with each other according to a fixed set of simple rules known as quantum mechanics, and which account for a plethora of various phenomena. Starting from these rules, I develop and implement novel methods that can used to simulate the behaviour particular condensed matter systems, with emphasis on realistic materials. 

## Machine Learning 

As opposed to being composed by a set of logical instructions, a machine learning algorithm automatically learns and improves its performance directly from experience. In recent years there has been a surge in the interest of deep neural networks, mainly driven by the availability of data and improvements the ability to train the machine learning models. The connection between machine learning and physics has a long history. Fundamental concepts in physics, such as the concept of energy, has a natural meaning in machine learning such as the loss landscape. Despite of its success, a coherent "theory of machine learning" is still amiss. 

## Quantum Complexity

Arguments from complexity theory suggest that quantum mechanics is vastly superior to classical mechanics from a computational point of view. The existence of Shorâ€™s famous integer factorization algorithm supports a common assumption, namely that all problems that can be solved efficiently on a classical computer can be solved at least as efficiently on a quantum computer, while the opposite might not be true. The realization of general purpose quantum computers has the potential to transform multiple sectors such as finance, security, and logistics. The need for scalability requires a high degree of computational fault-tolerance. Using tools from statistical learning theory and machine learning I develop methods to improve the accuracy of quantum computers. 


## Functional Theories

Solving the quantum-mechanical equations of motion is a computational problem of exponential complexity. A number of approaches known as functional theories has been suggested to adress this problem. One of the most promiment examples is the seminal work by Hohenberg and Kohn. They provided a formal way to map the interacting many-body problem to a variational problem solely formulated in the fermionic particle density. While this strategy results in a significant reduction in computational complexity, a major challenge is to viably include the exchange-correlaton effects in the functionanal approximations.
