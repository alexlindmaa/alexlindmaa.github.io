I am a researcher working in the field of condensed matter physics. I rely on a variety of theoretical and computational methods such as functional theories, machine learning, and statistical physics. Condensed matter physics involves the study of large numbers of electrons and nuclei that interact with each other according to a fixed set of rules known as quantum mechanics. Starting from these rules, I develop and implement methods that can used to simulate the behaviour particular condensed matter systems, with emphasis on realistic materials. 

## Machine Learning Physics 

Rather than being composed by a set of logical instructions, a machine learning algorithm automatically learns and improves its performance directly from experience. In recent years there has been a surge in the interest of deep neural networks, mainly driven by the availability of data and improvements the ability to train the machine learning models. As it turns out, the connection between machine learning and physics has a long history. Fundamental concepts in physics, such as the concept of energy, has a natural meaning in the language of machine learning. Despite of its success, a coherent "theory of machine learning" is still amiss.  

## Functional Theories

Solving the quantum-mechanical equations of motion is a problem of exponential complexity. A number of theories known as functional theoies has been suggested to adress this problem. In 1964 Hohenberg and Kohn provided a formal way to map the interacting many-body problem to a variational problem formulated in the fermionic particle density. While this strategy results in a significant reduction in computational complexity, a major unsolved problem is to viably include the exchange-correlaton effects in the approximations.
